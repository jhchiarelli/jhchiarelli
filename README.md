### A little about myself üí¨

I'm Jorge Henrique, programmer for over 20 years, passionate about technology. I went through experiences in several areas developing solutions on demand, such as ERP, Management Systems, Retail, Commerce and Electronic Games for Desktop (C / C ++), however in 2010 I started studying the development of **mobile applications** (native android with java and kotlin, native ios with swift and objc) and also **web aplication** (javascript, angular and php) I had the opportunity to also work on backend development (php, nodejs).

In 2017 I got to know the Dart language, where I have been studying and working on the development of mobile applications using the Flutter framework.

Today I work developing multiplatform applications and frontend / backend projects.
